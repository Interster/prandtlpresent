\chapter{Development framework}

\section{Introduction}
This is the development specifcation for the Prandtl aircraft.


\section{Airfoil}

Develop a set of reflexed airfoils with zero moment coefficient that is laminar.

\section{Spanwise optimization}


The spanwise airfoil shape as well as the lift distribution and twist has to be optimized in order to yield the bell shaped lift distribution.

\section{Mass budget}

The mass of the Prandtl wing is the primary driver for the optimization.  The mass is constant for battery aircraft therefore this technology is most suited.  Since the mass is the design optimization points.




\section{Different versions of the aircraft}

Prandtl 1 to 5 to show different stages of development.

\section{Conclusion}
This development specification should be consulted and used as a framework for the development for the Prandtl wing aircraft
